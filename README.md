# _Shrouded Woods_

Welcome to _Shrouded Woods_, my entry for the [Mozzila WebVR Experience Challenge](). It is a short game/experience where you land in a seemingly empty space where you can reveal the environment around you with a magic paint gun. Aditionnaly, Robin Hood hid 12 targets you will need to find in record time.

## How to play

* Go to [the demo page](https://LeonardA-L.github.io/ShroudedWoods)
* If you have a VR display, you should be able to access VR mode by pressing `v` or clicking "Toggle VR". If not, it works just fine dragging with the mouse and using the `SPACE` key.
* This project was built over two weeks and I could only get my hand on a Vive for a short test session, so Vive/Rift support might be a bit wonky. If your hands are reversed, please disconnect your controllers and reconnect them, *left first then right*.

Enjoy the game :)
